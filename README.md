My solutions to an earlier Advent of Code, December 2019

My solution to each day's puzzles.  In Scala unless otherwise noted.

1. Day  1:  The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation
2. Day  2:  1202 Program Alarm
3. Day  3: Crossed Wires

### Notes
#### Day 01
Had to look up solution to part two on Reddit.  For each mass calculate the fuel needed with the recursive formula.
Have to do separately for each mass and not work once from the fuel sum from each mass.  Very surprising how close the two numbers are (4812287 vs incorrect 4815103, maybe coincidence with my input?).
Still not sure I understand it.

#### Day 02
Works but used imperative programming instead of FP

#### Day 03
Some functional programming sytle but not all
